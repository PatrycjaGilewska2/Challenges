Your client, the local city hall, wants to keep track of CO2 levels across several city districts.
In order to do so, you agreed to install sensors throughout the city to provide CO2 concentration
readings each 5 minutes for each district to a given endpoint of your server.
As you plan to expand this solution to other cities in a multitenant fashion, sensors need to associate
the CO2 readings to a given customer account (authenticate themselves on the server).
So you'll need to define some access control.
Each city hall can check CO2 concentration historical data per district.
Create a data model in order to store and provide the sensor readings.
Design a REST API for creating and querying the CO2 data. The data should at least contain:
CO2 levels per sensor including timestamp
the district the sensor belongs to
the city the district belongs to
Make sure that each city hall can only query their own sensor readings.
